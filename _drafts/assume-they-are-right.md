title:  "Assume they are right"
---

When you're looking at code that came before you:

* Assume the code is correct
* Assume the code is efficient
* Assume the code had solid logic and reasoning behind it

Start there, and then seek to understand what the author's intentions were. Who knows? You might be wrong. 

Or you might save yourself from needing to re-learn the lessons from the past.
