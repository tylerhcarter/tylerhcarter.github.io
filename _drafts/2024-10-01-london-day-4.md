London (Monday) - We made it to the end of the London part of our trip, and how
our feet are tired! In London, we walked over 74,000 steps each. We've been out
and about from dawn until dusk, and while we might be looking more often for
places to sit down, its been quite a journey. Fortunately today is a travel day,
although we can't possibly leave London without visiting a couple of places
first.

Our first stop on our last day was Westminster Abbey. This is the famous chapel
across from the palace of Parliament that has been a big feature of British
history. In it, we got to tour through most of the halls seeing where monarch of
different people of note were buried. We also got to learn about how it operates
still as a church and a place of worship. We even got to ride an elevator with
one of the priests! One highlight was a new gallery that recently opened in the
upper levels of the abbey that featured different documents and artifacts that
had been tucked away in the past. The gallery highlighted on how the church had
interact with the monarch and the government throughout history, as well as
giving a spectacular and unique perspective of the church below.
