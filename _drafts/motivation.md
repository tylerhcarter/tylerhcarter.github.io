Why am I writing?

* I am writing for me. Not for other people.
* I am writing so I can parse through ideas. 
  * So I can find better ways to explain things
  * So I can catalog the thoughts and values I have
  * So I can memoize interesting techniques or projects I've seen
* I am writing so I can produce more than I consume
