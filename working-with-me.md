# Working With Me

A simple guide to who I am, and the best ways to work with me.

## What am I about?

### What’s important to me? What is my ideal? What do I see as success?

### What do I expect of team members?

### What do I do in the ideal world?

### What do I most want to share with people about me and how I lead?



## How do I like to operate?

### How do I best process information? For example, do I like to get the big picture and ask for details if I need them, or do I like the whole scenario explained from the ground up?

### How do I think?



### What are the best ways to communicate with me?

* For information sharing that does not require an immediate response, I prefer email. 
* If you need a response in a timely manner (~1 hour), use Teams/Slack/etc.
* If its about code, open a pull request, even if its not finished.
* If there needs to be a discussion, or we're exploring ideas that need my feedback, I'd love to step on a video call.

### What is the best way to give me information? For example, give me a summary and let me ask questions, or build up the complete picture?



### How do I prefer hearing about emergencies?

If its an emergency that needs my response, please use a phone call or text. For everything else, email is fine.

### Do I have certain times of the day when I’m more reachable or prefer to be reached?

My best times for conversations, meetings, etc, are in the morning. You can usually reach out to me asychronously before 9 AM, and for calls and meetings after. 

I reserve afternoons for focus and problem solving. Communication after 5 PM is usually 50/50 for responses, but I'll be sure get back to you in the morning (unless its an emergency!).

## What would be lousy?

### What might I need your help on? This is a chance to be clear about things that you don't do as well. For example, you might say, “I tend to be big picture. You may need to keep after me to get me down to concrete actions." When you show a willingness to share your blind spots, others on the team can help.

### How might I annoy you? 
### How might you annoy me? What are some things that are triggers for me?
