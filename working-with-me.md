# Working With Me

A simple guide to who I am, and the best ways to work with me.

## What am I about?

### What’s important to me? What is my ideal? What do I see as success?

I believe in doing everyday tasks with the bigger picture in mind. Our goal is never to build a product, complete a task, or implement a feature. It is always to be a better team than we were the day before. Because of this, I believe in trying new technologies and techniques, along with constantly going back to the basics.

My ideal is being on a team that is filled with people that are trying new things and care about what they do.

### What do I do in the ideal world?

## How do I like to operate?

### What are the best ways to communicate with me?

* For information sharing that does not require an immediate response, I prefer email. 
* If you need a response in a timely manner (~1 hour), use Teams/Slack/etc.
* If its about code, open a pull request, even if its not finished.
* If there needs to be a discussion, or we're exploring ideas that need my feedback, I'd love to step on a video call.

### How do I prefer hearing about emergencies?

If its an emergency that needs my response, please use a phone call or text. For everything else, email is fine.

### Do I have certain times of the day when I’m more reachable or prefer to be reached?

My best times for conversations, meetings, etc, are in the morning. You can usually reach out to me asychronously before 9 AM, and for calls and meetings after. I reserve afternoons for focus and problem solving. 

After 5 PM, I turn off my work laptop and most work communication (messaging, email) is no longer visible on my phone. If you need a response, phone or text.
