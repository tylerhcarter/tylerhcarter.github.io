# Working With Me

A simple guide to who I am, and the best ways to work with me.

### What’s important to me? What is my ideal? What do I see as success?

I believe in doing everyday tasks with the bigger picture in mind. Our goal is never to build a product, complete a task, or implement a feature. It is always to be a better team than we were the day before. Because of this, I believe in trying new technologies and techniques, along with constantly going back to the basics.

My ideal is being on a team that is filled with people that are trying new things and care about what they do.

### What are the best ways to communicate with me?

* For items requiring a thoughtful response, I prefer email. 
* If its about code, open a pull request and mention me with a question or comment, even if its not finished.
* If there needs to be a discussion, or we're exploring ideas that need my feedback, I'd love to step on a call.
* For everything else, there's teams/slack. 

### How do I prefer hearing about emergencies?

If its an emergency that needs my response, please use a phone call or text. For everything else, email is fine. Teams notifications are not enabled on my mobile devices, but my contact information is listed on my profile.

### Do I have certain times of the day when I’m more reachable or prefer to be reached?

My best times for conversations, meetings, etc, are in the morning. You can usually reach out to me asychronously before 9 AM, and for calls and meetings after. I reserve afternoons for focus and problem solving. 

Notifications through teams are disabled on my mobile devices. Work email notifications are turned off outside of M-F, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM.
