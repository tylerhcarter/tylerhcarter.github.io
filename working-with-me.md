A simple guide to who I am, and the best ways to work with me.

### What motivates me?

I believe in doing everyday tasks with the goal of always getting better. I enjoy trying new technologies and techniques, along with constantly going back to the basics. My ideal is being on a team that is filled with people that are trying new things and care about what they do.

### What are the best ways to communicate with me?

* For items requiring a thoughtful response, I prefer email. 
* If its about code, open a pull request and mention me with a question or comment. The code does not need to be finished, or even working.  
* If there needs to be a discussion, or we're exploring ideas that need my feedback, I'd love to step on a call. 
* For everything else, there's Teams/Slack. I regularly block time that I do not check messages as to focus on deep work. If applicable, see below for emergencies.

### How do I prefer hearing about emergencies?

If its an emergency that needs my response, please use a phone call or text. For everything else, email is fine. Teams notifications are not enabled on my mobile devices, but my contact information is listed on my profile.

### Do I have certain times of the day when Iâ€™m more reachable or prefer to be reached?

My best times for conversations, meetings, etc, are in the morning. You can usually reach out to me asychronously before 9 AM, and for calls and meetings after. I reserve afternoons for focus and problem solving. 

Notifications through teams are disabled on my mobile devices. Work email notifications are turned off outside of M-F, 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM.
