The hacker mentality betrays us at times. This mindset that can shake its head at popular tools in search for the latest and greatest; often can be blinded to the upsides of those same popular tools. For example:

* WordPress is an amazing tool for allow creators to deliver content with little/no coding experience required.
* Next.js is a powerful React-based framework that makes starting a "server-rendered website" incredibly simple.
* Bootstrap is a revolutionary HTML/CSS/JS framework that makes it easy to layout responsive designs on the web.

Each of these tools are incredibly useful, have large communities supporting them and building compatible products, have been battled tested over and over again, and are still actively being developed. 

Maybe your client's next project doesn't need to use this week's flavor of Javascript framework. Maybe the quickest road to a successful and maintainable website involves tools that just keep truckin'.
