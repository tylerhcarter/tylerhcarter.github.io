## Managing Our Time as an Act of Worship

> Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.  
> Psalm 90:12 [^2]

* Pauls says the "days are evil". Our time, by default, is spent sinfully - selfishly toiling for our own benefit.
* But Paul also commands us to "\[make\] the most of your time" which literally translates to "redeeming your time" or "buying back your time" [^3]
* We redeem our time by using it to give God glory. For instance in Deuteronomy 6, God instructs His people on how to spend their time - remembering Him, teaching about Him to our children, doing good in His sight, etc.
* Moses cries out in the Psalms for wisdom by being taught to "number our days". We were meant to make the most of the time we have here on Earth.
* But we are not to use our time to make ourselves rich and famous. Instead, we are called to our time to do good works that bring God glory. [^3]

**Where do you find yourself with "unredeemed" time?**

## Releasing Our Time as an Act of Humility

> Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to such and 
> such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and 
> make a profit.” Yet you do not know what your life will be like 
> tomorrow. For you are just a vapor that appears for a little while, 
> and then vanishes away. Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, 
> we will live and also do this or that.” But as it is, you boast in your 
> arrogance; all such boasting is evil.  
> James 4:13-16 [^4]

> Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.   
> Proverbs 27:1 [^5]

* We live in a time when "productivity" and "time management" are a hot trend and seemingly ultimate solution to our problems.
* Yet, James cautions us against getting too attached to our plans. [^4]
* Proverbs reminds us that our time is ultimately in God's control. [^5]
* Despite our most intentional, thought out plans, we are cautioned to hold them lightly as we are not God.

**What is a time when your plans were completely changed from something outside your control?**

## Sanctifying Our Time

> Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the 
> one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
> Romans 13:8 [^8]

> [Your time] is not your own, for you were bought 
> with a price. So glorify God in your [schedule].  
> 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 [^7] 

> Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet 
> pressing needs, so that they will not be unproductive.
> Titus 3:14 [^9]

* God calls us to devote our time to love. For our time is not our own. [^7]
* This can be through the good that God calls us to do proactively through our careers, etc. 
* This can also be through reactive good of blessing others in urgent need that often can interrupt our plans. [^6]
* Ultimately, God calls us to "engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so \[we\] will not be unproductive." [^9]

**What is something you can do this week to "redeem" some of your time for the glory of God?**
