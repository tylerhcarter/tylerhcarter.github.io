title:  "Fireflies"
---

In my robotics team in high school, we had an amazing rookie year. I remember all year long we had worked hard, winning an award at regionals and making it all the way up to the Championship. I was sure we were going to all the way to the top!

And then, we didn't. All the awards were given out, Fireflies by Owl City came on to send all the robotics kids home, and I was crushed.

It takes very little to _not_ believe in something; to be convinced that something is impossible or improbable. There is nothing at stake for the naysayers. 

But, to put blood, sweat, and tears into a goal that many would never even attempt? To work towards something you could fail at? That takes courage. To have hope is a courageous act.
