title:  "Free Yourself"

I have spent a lot of time tweaking. Preferences, tooling, themes, fonts. I have combed through settings menus and configuration panels looking to get something just the way I have wanted it. And then? Oops. Times up. Guess I can't start on that project. 

There is a beauty in letting go of your preferences. Allowing the tools, the language, the framework, to simply be what they are. To release the need for them to work exactly how you would prefer. To lean into a workflow envisioned by someone else.

And in return, you enjoy the experience of getting something done.
