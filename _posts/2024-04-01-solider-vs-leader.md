title:  "Solider vs Leader"
---

A solider in the field has a limited perspective of the battlefield. They can only see what is right in front of them. 
Its often the same for many developers. Their focus only sees the stories, requirements, or project they're in the middle of.

The difference between a solider and a leader is what they pay attention to. Leaders will keep one eye on the task at hand, and another eye on the bigger picture. 

Why are we building this feature? What problem is it solving? What value is it providing? Where is our team, department, organization heading? How can I help us get there faster?
